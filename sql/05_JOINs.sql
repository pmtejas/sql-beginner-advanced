/* ============================================================================== 
   BASIC JOINS 
=============================================================================== */

-- No Join
/* Retrieve all data from customers and orders as separate results */


-- INNER JOIN
/* Get all customers along with their orders, 
   but only for customers who have placed an order */


-- LEFT JOIN
/* Get all customers along with their orders, 
   including those without orders */


-- RIGHT JOIN
/* Get all customers along with their orders, 
   including orders without matching customers */


-- Alternative to RIGHT JOIN using LEFT JOIN
/* Get all customers along with their orders, 
   including orders without matching customers */


-- FULL JOIN
/* Get all customers and all orders, even if thereâ€™s no match */


/* ============================================================================== 
   ADVANCED JOINS
=============================================================================== */

-- LEFT ANTI JOIN
/* Get all customers who haven't placed any order */


-- RIGHT ANTI JOIN
/* Get all orders without matching customers */


-- Alternative to RIGHT ANTI JOIN using LEFT JOIN
/* Get all orders without matching customers */


-- Alternative to INNER JOIN using LEFT JOIN
/* Get all customers along with their orders, 
   but only for customers who have placed an order */


-- FULL ANTI JOIN
/* Find customers without orders and orders without customers */


-- CROSS JOIN
/* Generate all possible combinations of customers and orders */


/* ============================================================================== 
   MULTIPLE TABLE JOINS (4 Tables)
