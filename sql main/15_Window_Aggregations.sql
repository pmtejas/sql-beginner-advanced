   SQL Window Aggregate Functions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   These functions allow you to perform aggregate calculations over a set 
   of rows without the need for complex subqueries. They enable you to compute 
   counts, sums, averages, minimums, and maximums while still retaining access 
   to individual row details.
